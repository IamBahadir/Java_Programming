Abstraction Topics:

            Abstract Method
            Abstract Class
            Interface

- Process of hiding implementation details from the user
- Only the functionality will be provided to the user
- Focusing on the essential qualities of something rather than one specific example
- User will have the information what the object does instead of how it does


            Abstract Method :
            - A method that does not have body, only signature
            - A method that's meant to be overridden
            - Abstract keyword is used to create abstract method

            public abstract void calculate();

            * can not be static
            * can not be final
            * does not have private access modifier
            * does not have body
            * can only be created in an abstract class or in an interface


Car Task:
        abstract Car:
            make,model,color,year,price..
            start(); public abstract void start();
            stop();
        Honda extends Car:
            start(): twist the key
        Audi extends Car:
            start(): push to start button
        Tesla extends Car:
            start(): Say start

Employee task:
            abstract Person :
            name, age, gender(final)

            eat();
            sleep();

            abstract Employee extends Person :

                id(final), jobTitle, salary..

                public abstract work(); // it can not be final and static , does not have any body

                and also abstract method can only be created in an abstract class or in an interface
