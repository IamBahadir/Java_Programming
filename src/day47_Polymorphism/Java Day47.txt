Definition of the polymorphism ;

           Ability of the object to take on many forms

           When the polymorphism occurs;
           'in a relation'


           Reference type is pareNt class/interface, and object type is child class

           instance --> to check which object stored in the reference type.

Dynamic polymorphism:
                    Method overriding
                    One method with multiple implementations
Static polymorphism:
                    Multiple methods with same name
                    each method has one implementation ONLY


    Webdriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
    driver.takeScreenShot();

    Animal animal = new Tiger(); Reference name is must meaningful (animal)

    Employee employee = new Developer();


What is the meaning of the casting:

        Converting one type to another


    Type of Casting

    1 Primitive Type casting : must happen between primitives

         -Implicit primitive type casting : casting smaller primitive type to large primitive type
          Byte - short - int - long - float - double

          char - boolean

         -Explicit primitive type casting : casting larger primitive type to smaller primitive type

    2 Reference Type casting : there must be inheritance

         -Upcasting:

                    Casting the smaller reference type(sub type) to larger reference type (super type)

                Animal animal1 = new Dog(); // upcasting
                Cat cat = new Cat();

                Animal animal2 = cat; // upcasting
                ---------------------------
                Phone phone1 = new Iphone(); // upcasting

                Samsung samsung = new Samsung();

                Phone phone2 = samsung; // upcasting


         -Downcasting
