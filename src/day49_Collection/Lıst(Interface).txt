List - one of the child (interface) of the Collection (interface)

What is special about the List :

                it allows duplicated (1,1,2,3,3,3)
                it has index number
                insertion order preserved


Each class has its own specialization.

-ArrayList  :
             it is the best option, if searching the element is the priority
-LinkedList :
             it is the best option, if inserting or deleting any element is priority
-Vector     :
             it is the best option, if the synchronizing is the priority

             -Thread-

             sequence of process ;
             sequence : a particular order in which related events
             process  : instance of execution for the program

             Only one thread has an access the shared resource at a time (Thread-safety)


             for example :
                          if any user try to access their internet banking on mobile application or on a web browser at the same time,
                          the user does not allow to reach both of them.
                          Only one thread has one access the shared resource at a time.
                          this is the synchronizing..


    -Stack  :
             What is the difference between the stack and vector ?

             When it comes to the take out the inserted order one by one,
             Stack is the best option.

             LIFO (Last in & First out order )

             Pop method is special just for stack
