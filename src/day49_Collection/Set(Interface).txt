                    Set (Interface)
    HashSet (Class)          SortedSet (Interface)
    LınkedHashSet (Class)    TreeSet (Class)


What distinguishes the HashSet (Class) from others?

    * When it comes to the Set, Most of the time will use the HashSet.

    - Implement the Set interface
    - Maintains the random order ( that makes it faster )
      10, 20, 30, 40, 50 --> { 20, 10, 50, 40, 30 }

    - Accept null values

What distinguishes the LınkedHashSet (Class) from others?

    - Maintains the insertion oder
      20, 50, 40, 30, 50  --> {20, 50, 40, 30, 50}

    - Accept null values


What distinguishes the TreeSet (Class) from others?

    - Implement the SortedSet interface
    - Maintains the sorted order
      20, 10, 50, 40  --> 10, 20, 40, 50
    - Does not accept null values
