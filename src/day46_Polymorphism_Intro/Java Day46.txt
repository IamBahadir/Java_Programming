Java Day46

package name : day46_Polymorphism Intro

Encapsulation - hiding the data
Inheritance   - Building a relationship / we don't need to create common features one bye one

Abstraction   - hiding the implementation data
              - blueprint of a class / we don't need to create common method one by one
    Interface - add more additional information if the class needed,
                access modifier just assign Public
                it contains three type of methods - default - static - abstract

Polymorphism  - Many Forms

              <--Polymorphism Rules-->

                Reference type can be parent class or interface

                Object type can be any extending or implementing child class

                Reference type decides what is accessible

                Object type decides which implementation of the method to be executed
              when the method is called

              <--Calling the method in polymorphism-->

                Only the methods in reference type can be called

                When we call a method, it will call overriden version from a child class
              if method is not overridden, it will call parent/super class version
