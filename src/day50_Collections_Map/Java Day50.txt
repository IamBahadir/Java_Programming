    Collection (I) : dynamic sized
                     ready methods
                     for non-primitives Only

                     extended by List Queue and Set

               List (I)  : duplicates are allowed, has an index number
                         ArrayLÄ±st (C)  : searching or accessing elements are faster
                         LinkedList (C) : inserting or deleting elements are faster
                         Vector (C)     : is synchronized Thread-safe
                         Stack (C)      : is synchronized Thread-safe, LIFO
                                          pop() --> this is special just for Stack.

               Set (I)   : duplicates are NOT allowed, does NOT have index number
                         HashSet (C)      : Maintains random order
                         LinkedHashSet (C): Maintains insertion order
                         TreeSet (C)      : Maintains sorted order , does not accept null value

               Queue (I) : duplicates are allowed, does NOT have index number, FIFO
                           poll () --> this is special just for Queue.

                           PriorityQueue (C) : Maintains random order
                           ArrayDequeue (C)  : Maintains insertion order
                           LinkedList (C)    : it has an index number, maintains insertion order
